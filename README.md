### The Gititudes

 - Git never forgets
 - Git remembers only changes in files and not simply files
 - Git will only commit changes in the index and not changes in the working directory
 - Git tries really hard to protect you from horrible mistakes
 - Git provides the means to craft a History as YOU WANT IT TO BE
